I am a writer, I want to write new events, But I am not a coder.

<B>Malen</B>:
<I>If someone wants to write some porn scene, send it to me and I program it in.  
It could contain anything, and since I am working on its technical side right now, contentwise I haven't added anything.</I>
  
You can send a PM to <B>Malen</B> on tfgamessite

All you need to do is:  
(1) Prepare your texts
(2) Describe how would this scene goes
(3) Find some pictures, or describe what kind of pictures are needed
Then we can do the coding, and put them into next release.
