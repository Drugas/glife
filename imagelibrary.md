I. File structures
-
This file structure is for 0.6.0 release, 2017/4/3.

We continue to use the image pack method from 0.5.3, with core pack and updates.    
Two step to install:  

1-1 Unpacking .zip files
-
Unpack any .zip files with the free program 7zip or similar.

1-2 If this is a new copy of game:   
-
Download <i>Core pack - 0.6.0 full.7z</i>(3.75G) from [Mega](https://mega.nz/#!ctQGDYyb!8uN0cBdbsMYhWPo15yFfDHE5FBI063I2L8TmPa9iWIo) or [Yandex-1](https://yadi.sk/d/PhlPbxx53Ge6GK), [Yandex-2](https://yadi.sk/d/JFvHAv5m3GcraZ), [Yandex-3](https://yadi.sk/d/qUg5MTC_3GcmBa)
    
2. Update packs
-
Download <i> None yet

Then unzip them all to the same folder as .qsp files.

II. How do i integrate the images?
-
Create a folder called Girl Life, put the .QSP file in there and all the image folders you have for the game into it, they will promt you to overwrite if you are replacing with the optional gifs and/or Russian images pack. It should then just work out the rest by itself.  

Your game folder should look like this:  
![eto_folder_e](/uploads/7341babd143b1aad82234af200cee983/eto_folder_e.jpg)  
<B>images</B> contain 7 main folders, about 3.75 Gb  including <B>avatar.jpg</B> your custom Avatar if you choose to customize your character.  
<B>sounds</B> contain 98 files, 263 Mb
<B>glife.qsp</B> is the main game file. You must launch it with Quest Soft Player.
