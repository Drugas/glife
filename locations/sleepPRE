I miscalculated something, for example due to sharp hormonal change you have bad acme on your face and I failed to change your eyes and lips. On the bright side, your body will change much faster than the one of a natural born woman. That means it will be easier to gain and lose weight and change facial features. All in all you turned quite well. By the way, your new ''equipment'' down there is fully functional, so if you don''t want to be a mommy, you should think about using contraceptives."'

On a side note, I already took care of an alibi. Today Michael crashed his car into the pit and died, it''s on the news." With these words, Tatiana picked up the remote and turned on the TV.'

The body that ''died'' behind the wheel of the BMW was a perfect copy of your old self, from your absorbed amulet energy down to the placement of every single hair."'

				'You look at him. "Forget it. Listen Gustav... what do I do now?"'
				'Gustav nods and says, "Well, I would advise you to start by buying food, all sorts of washing powders, laundry detergents and dishes. There are very few supplies already in the apartment, but they''ll only last you a day or two. There''s no TV either. Then get a job. Not far from your new home is a small café, if I remember correctly there was a vacant waitress position not too long ago. You should talk to the owner of the café about the job. Don''t forget to monitor your health, keep your mood up and have a clear mind."'
				'"Now your mind is very weak, if you don''t take care of yourself you will go crazy. You need to eat well, sleep regularly, have fun, do not generally become depressive or else you end up in a madhouse. Don''t go looking for Tatiana, you will not find her anyway, and secondly, if we need to contact you, we will find you."'
				'You arrived at some five-story Khrushchev era buildings. Gustav stops the car and points a finger at the entrance. "Your apartment number 69, Tatiana already gave you the key. Now go. Remember don''t just give up, not everyone gets an entirely new chance at life. Tatiana and me will keep an eye out for you."'
