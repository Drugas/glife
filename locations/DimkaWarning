   '"What do you want?" you ask rather more sharply than you intended.'

	'You go into the hallway and see a package on the cabinet near the mirror. Curious, you look to see who it is for and see that it is addressed to your mother. You feel horror wash over you as you recognise the handwriting as well as the "Private" written on the box as being Dimka''s.'
	'Grabbing the package, you take it into the bathroom and carefully open it, trying not to damage the wrapping. Fortunately, Dimka only used very small pieces of tape to seal the box so you were able to open it. As you feared, the box contains copies of the pictures from the video only this time your face is blacked out as is the background making it impossible to tell who it is in the picture. You rip up the pictures into very small pieces and flush them down the toilet. Spying some sample shampoo bottles you got at the market the other day, you put them in the box and reseal it.'
	'Taking the resealed package, you put it back on the cabinet then go to your room to think.'
