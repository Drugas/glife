She is pretty athletic and does surprisingly well in school considering how little of the school work she does when she bothers to attend. She is not a traditional beauty, her face is too masculine for that, but she is attractive and could be even more so if she bothered to try, but she doesn''t. She seems to care only about two things, booze and fighting. The booze she gets any way she can, like stealing or smooching from the boys in exchange for some favors. Or she buys it from her considerable amount of money (her father is an army Colonel, that is why he is rarely around). When she "plays" with the boys, it only goes as far as she wants it. She is the only girl other than Lena who can say that, but while they are afraid of Lena''s brother, Katyusha prefers to beat the boys herself. She practices Sambo in the park every day before school, regardless of weather. She often taunts or makes fun of the boxers, claiming boxing is for pussies, real fighters fight without rules. She doesn''t count herself a gopnik, only others consider her one. This doesn''t bother her because she only cares about the opinion of the people whom earn her respect. That is really hard to do.'
