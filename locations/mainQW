				'You get up from the couch and dress. You ask Tatiana, "So? Did you learn anything else about me?"'
				'"Yes, but first I need to explain the basic magic theory. Listen closely and listen hard, I will not repeat this. Magical energy in Asian culture is called chakra and is produced by all living organisms. This vital energy, if deprived of it the body begins to slowly die, the symptom of a lack of magical energy is a bad mood. By itself it can not kill, but it undermines the body and the mind, causing exhaustion which eventually makes either the body or mind fail, resulting in death or madness."'
				'"There is magical energy in the grass,trees and people but not in dead matter it is the energy of life itself. Although everyone has this energy, the body protects itself prohibiting the use of it. It is easy to exhaust the body and can kill yourself. Mages are able to simply bypass the body''s defenses and separate themselves from the energy and shape it into effect. The main task of a magician is to maximise their potential and learn to draw their energy as much as possible."'
				'"But mages can not collect more energy than they can contain. You''re lucky you can contain as much energy as any magician could ask for. You just need to learn how to use it. As I understand it, your orgasms are capable of handling Rikudos energy and making it your own, but each new stage will be harder to achieve. Maybe there are some ways to recycle that energy in you, but most importantly, your magical energy supply is almost limitless, unlike other magicians."'
				'"You know, you''re theoretically the most powerful magician in the world, as Rikudo was the strongest in history. Perhaps there is a school of magic that can only work with the force Rikudo. Most likely the spells were on the scrolls that were in the dungeon with the amulet.'
				'You shout. "Igor! Igor took one of the scrolls!"'
				'"Just don''t go thinking I''ll be there for you to solve all your problems. If you want to look for this Igor, you''re on your own."'
				'"I have no idea where he lives." You muse. "Maybe I''ll find a clue in the trench were this started."'
				'"Do you think the Order of Dawn didn''t already think of this? Aah, I see you do not quite understand what the Order of Dawn is. They are not some whipping boys. They''re all magicians of the highest order. Neither I nor Juugo are good enough to even hold a candle to any of them. Any one of them can destroy Juugo without breaking a sweat. They fight with strong magic and unique technology. Do not mess with these guys, they are pros in their field. Their main business is destruction of other magicians and capturing demons."'
				'"Woah! Demons?'
				'"Demons, you know, creatures from other plains of existence. It''s possible that Rikudo was a demon, but demons unlike him are beings with terrible force, blunt and aggressive. Something like beasts woven from pure magic."'
				if StoryLine = 0:
					'"Got it. Hey, you can turn me back into a man?"'
					'"Can. But won''t. You have no idea how much energy it took out of me, I squeezed myself to dry and Juugo. I barely had enough energy. Now I do not have enough physically strength for the energy consumption, I went to the limit of my sanity and I lost some of it forever. And there''s more to consider, now that your body begins to absorb magic and it becomes even harder. It might be possible if your magical energies reach at least level 10 and you pass me all your energy forever. I can make you again the same, but you''ll never be a magician, this path will be forever closed to you."'
