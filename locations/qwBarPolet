		'"Thickset?"'
		'"Yeah, you know... You said I was skinny, so I thought, maybe you are used to women having a lot of... curves."'

		'"Eating right and overeating are two entirely different things, corazón. And I didn''t mean that you were skinny as in ''too thin'', but that you could use a little more mass to work with."'
		'"Are you my bartender or my personal trainer?"'
		'"I can be both," he grins.'

		'"I think that you are pulling my leg."'
		'He recoils in mock-shock. "That you would even <b>suggest</b> that! The insolence!"'
		'You grin at his antics, but your question is still to the point: "Do you do anything besides working out?"'
		'"This and that," he replies, now more serious. "I don''t know what you want to hear, <<$pcs_firstname>>. I don''t run a drug ring or strip club on the side, if that''s what you want to know. Days pass pretty quickly, even when all you do is sleep, work out and go for a walk every now and then."'
		'"You should share that thought at the next book club meeting," you comment dryly.'
		'"I''d rather not. It would only disturb the other housewives," Martin retorts.'
		'You chuckle - it''s strange how these conversations with Martin always take the most extraordinary turns. You know that he doesn''t talk to his other regulars like this. Actually, from what you can tell, it seems like he''s acting different with every one of them, adapting to their character, maybe even to their needs. You suggested it before to him, but now you are really starting to understand why they keep coming here, what they see in this place and its scary-looking owner.'
