Apparently the surge occurred when you opened the seal to the archive. Anyway, that was when we started to search, that source of power is desired by many, but it is extremely dangerous and in the wrong hands could do untold horrors."'

But if I say, hurl a fireball, then people might see that I threw a grenade or shot from a flamethrower. The human mind can''t process magic, so it blocks it as a way to protect the person from going crazy."'
