'"Ah, you''re awake," she chirps. "I told this jerk Gustav that he should have treated you more carefully, but he''s bad at listening. As a result I had to use some magic to stabilize you, he almost knocked you out permanently."'
'"While you were unconscious I did some research on you. Turns out the Amulet of Power passed to you. Must have happened when you touched it. Unfortunately, Reinhold, the guy in your room, he''s probably realized by now that the amulet no longer has the power and now he''s out to hunt you down."'

	'"What the hell is going on?" you respond. You try to move your hands, but you''re tied to the bed.'
	'"Um, okay, I''ll start from the beginning," the girl says. "Magic exists and is real. Ages ago the world was not the same, the fae creatures who possess natural magic lived in balance but the succubus were free to breed with whom ever they wished."'
	'"They breed with humans with that human magicians were born. The Sidhe as the most powerful of the fae feared the increasing numbers of human magicians and cast a very powerful spell to bind the succubus to them, this prevented either from being able to reproduce without the other."'
	'"All magicians have some of that original fae blood in there bodies and it is through that that they are able to connect with the world of magic."

	'The redhead adjusts her glasses. "Most of the world simply ignore magic or are protected from it by magic''s natural desire to remain hidden."'
	'"But last night there was a powerful burst of magical energy, strong enough to be clearly seen by any with magical connections. Can you guess where this surge came from? Yeah, that cave you found. Apparently the surge occurred when you opened the seal to the archive. Anyway, that was when we started to search, that source of power is desired by many, but it is extremely dangerous and in the wrong hands could do untold horrors."'
	'She stops for a few seconds for you process that information. It seems really far fetched.' 
	'"As you can figure out, Reinhold wanted to prevent the amulet being misused, but he was not very thorough and didn''t check you over."'

		'The girl nods. "Yes. You''re a quick study. Machines, apartments, television and the Internet, all this really does exist and is in the form in which people see it. But if I say, hurl a fireball, then people might see that I threw a grenade or shot from a flamethrower. The human mind can't process magic, so it blocks it as a way to protect the person from going crazy."'
		'"Hence such things as little green men, UFOs, poltergeists, spontaneous combustion, are when people encounter a difficult to hide phenomenon and the conclusion is flawed. In some cases, if someone''s mind can not cope with the spell they witness, they can be driven crazy and then no one believes them."'

I have little combat skill, so I rely on the services of Gustav to provide some muscle. He''s a Mutant, his mutation is due to magical exposure and it gives him unmatched physical strength and he is a great tracker."'

				'"But this is not good for you. You may think that since you have the amulets'' power, you can do anything. But in reality, you''re helpless without the skill to use it. Reinhold easily overpowered your will and forced you to obey, and Gustav beat you like a puppy."'

"It was made by the trickster Rikudo, one of the most powerful ancient magicians before he died, he taunted the only living mage who could control its immense power by cursing him to be stuck in a female form and making it only activate for a male mage."'
					'"Great. So I''ve been thrown into this mess by the dead owner of that ancient tomb. Hang on I''m not a mage, how could the power be transferred to me?"'
					'"It seems that its long time underground has caused it to malfunction and its power has entered your body. The bad news is it is far too powerful and will kill you." At this you are filled with fear and start to struggle against your bindings.'
					'"You are lucky Reinhold didn''t realise this, he would have stopped you from accidentally wielding the power and killing yourself and who knows how many others by killing you in that hotel room. I have another way to save you, but you''re not going to like it."'
					'You don''t say anything, so she continues, "I can feel the aura of power emanating from you, by drawing from that I can perform a powerful magic spell that will transform you into someone who is protected from the masculine alignment of the power."

						'Your eyes widen in shock.'
						'"Well, there is another way, I can just stop your heart and let your power dissolve into nature, but you will die. I''m not Reinhold, I can take this risk and I don''t want to kill you. Maybe with more time doing research I can work out another solution, but I cannot leave you like this."'

							'"As for your family, not to worry. I''ll arrange everything. We will fabricate your death to get Reinhold off your back. To make your transition easier I''ll cover your memory of the family, they will only be ghostly memories, you won''t even remember where you lived. Don''t worry, I won''t erase your entire memory and leave you a useless vegetable."'

You will need a to use a new name, think it over in your dreams and tell me when you wake up, otherwise I will give you a pretty name. Now go to sleep."
