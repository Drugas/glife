# cum_call

!{$ARGS[0] is for the location and should be set for all but vaginal:
'labia' - 'pantyfront' - 'anus' - 'butt' - 'pantyrear' - 'clothesgroin' - 'clothes' - 'back' - 'legs'
'arms' - 'face' - 'mouth' - 'hands' - 'stomach' - 'breasts' - 'hair' - 'internalcondom'
$ARGS[1] is for the name of the sexual partner
ARGS[2] is a for knowing the partner. Defaults to 0.
	0 - unknown sex partner (his name may be known, but she newer saw him before, and likely won't ever again, or she won't remeber it)
	1 - sex partner is known for MC (classmate, neighbor, someone she new beforehand)
	2 - MC is unaware of the act (like unconscious sex)
ARGS[3] is contraception, if left blank it will use the default, if you want to force a particular type:
	1 - he thought you were on the pill but you weren't.
	2 - you are on the Pill
	3 - Condom. Condoms can still fail vy the code.
	4 - the Condom Broke. This is mostly used to check if cum manage resulted in a broken condom.
	5 - the Condom Slipped off. Like 4, this is mostly to check if the contraception of 3 had a failure. But both 4 and 5 can be specified if you want to write an event where it fails no matter what.
	6 - the condom was Sabotaged but the main character shouldn't know that
	7 - the Condom was Sabotaged by the main character.
ARGS[4] is for changing the potency, -1 for unable to impregnate, default is 10,000
ARGS[5] is volume, default is 40 (4ml)
For a simple call you only need the first 3, ie:
gs 'cum_call', 'anus', 'Kolka', 1 - for a known partner
gs 'cum_call', 'anus' - for an unknown partner named "unknown", or
gs 'cum_call', 'anus', 'plumber' - for an unknown partner named "plumber"}
