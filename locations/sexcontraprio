!{Function that when given 2 different contraception types, returns the "higher priority" of the two. In brief, if PC had sex with the same guy twice with any two random contraceptive methods, which one would she think was the reason she got pregnant?}

!0 - No contraception
!1 - Lied about the pill
!4 - Condom broke
!5 - Condom fell off
!7 - You sabotaged the condom
!6 - Someone else sabotaged the condom
!2 - You were on the pill
!8 - Precum had sperm in it
