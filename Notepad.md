# QSP language for Notepad++
<B>Lantera</B>:  
These instructions will explain how to make Notepad++ look like QGen in a few simple steps.

See FinnMachas' note below for latest language file. If you don't know how to obtain from repo download this file. It contains screenshots, and an XML file you will need. The numbers of the steps below correspond with the screenshots included: https://mega.nz/#!6cUCiLoA!1VgQPg0-xgMLrXOHYF92WTEh60XEOia6Dqcy_1n_Nys

1. In Notepad++, in the upper bar, find 'Language'. At the bottom of this menu, you will find an option 'Define your Language'. Click that.
2. When you clicked it, it'll bring up a menu where you can design your own language. We''re not going to do that. Instead, click the 'Import' button, near the left-hand top.
3. It'll look for .xml files. Luckily you have one! Right? It''s in the same folder as your screenshots. Find it and Import it.
4. There's a drop-down menu at the very left-hand top of the 'Define your Language' menu. The default is User Define Language. Click it. One of the options will be called QSP (you just imported that in step 3). Click it.
5. Now that we have imported the XML file and highlighted it, we need to give it a name so we can use the language definitions. Choose 'Save As' and choose a name. I named mine 'QSP'.
6. Then close Notepad++, and re-open it again. If you did everything correctly, you will now see QSP (or whatever name you gave your profile) at the very bottom of the 'Language' menu.

Select the profile, and Notepad++ will look exactly like QGen does. Hopefully. Especially if you switch your background colour to grey.

Updated Information. The below xml are based on the above version, but greatly expanded.
We now also have the .xml files in the game repo so you don’t have to use the link above to download the .xml.

QSP1.xml [This version is for ‘default’ white theme as set from Settings – Style Configurator – Select theme]
QSP4.xml [This version is for ‘Deep Black’ theme as set from Settings – Style Configurator – Select theme]

Personally, I work with QSP4, so it is the most up to date. And it looks awesome!!
