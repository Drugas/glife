If you want to help as a dev for this project, the route is something like:  
  
1. Create your git.tfgamessite.com account (it is a different on from the main TFGS site).  
2. Fork https://git.catrenelle.com/Kevin_Smarts/glife. This will create a copy that is your own.  
3. Change whatever your like, and push them to your own repository.  
4. Submit a pull request. This is the git way of asking someone else to merge your code to the game.
