There are 3 game modes. The first one, where you get transformed from a man to a girl, was the original storyline. Currently, the Alternate Start (and Cursed Schoolgirl) are further developed. If you want to play the game with most events, it's advised to play the Cursed Schoolgirl Start.


- Original Start:<br>
You are Michael Kuznetsov, a fairly average, 35 year old businessman whose life is about to be turned inside out. Features magic and an (incomplete) over-arching plot.
This will begin with the starting plot and MtF transformation that the game relies upon, before leaving you in the [city](city) with some money, basic supplies and a rented flat.
<br><br>
- Alternate Start:<br>
You are a 15 or 16 year old small-town girl with another year of school remaining. Name and starting stats are customizable, no magic and no major ''plot'' other than life. Not to say that your classmates and family don''t have their own stories, though!
