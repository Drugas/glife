Branches

master  - This is where we develop most of the game.
release - Current release bug fix.

Remember

- Try to keep the game playable ... always. Bugs will happen but obvious mistakes can be eliminated in a simple testing run.
- Be careful! Do not erase other people work. Git offer some help with that but sometimes we have to resolve conflicts ourselves.
