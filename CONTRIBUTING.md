# Girl Life - ECV: Contribution Guide

## Branches

*master*  - This is where we develop most of the game.

*release* - Current release bug fix.

## Remember

- Try to keep the game playable ... always. Bugs will happen but obvious mistakes can be eliminated in a simple testing run.
- Be careful! Do not erase other people work. 
    - Git offer some help with that but sometimes we have to resolve conflicts ourselves.
- Try to make **meaningful** commit messages.
    - You can use emojis like: :wrench:, :recycle:, :new:, :x:, :shower:. Just dont overload :smile:

- Commit **often** and in **small** chunks. 
    - If revert is needed we dont loose much.
